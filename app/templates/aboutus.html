It includes three units: Understanding Nutrients, The Journey of Food, and Building Healthy Habits. Each unit will help kids to better understand the what they eat and build a healthy relationship with food.

                I made this site in order to educate children of all backgrounds on the importance of healthy eating and provide real methods for building better dietary habits. As a teenager who has always had a harmful relationship with food, I want to ensure that future kids avoid my own mistakes and prioritize health over convenience.
